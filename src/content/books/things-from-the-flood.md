description: It started on Christmas Day in 1994. Dark water suddenly rose from the land, invading our homes and lives. They say it came from the depths inside the Loop. Whatever it was the Flood changed everything. Nothing would ever be the same again.

Simon Stalenhag takes us to an extraordinary world, a world of fear and discovery, in a story told through his gut-punchingly spare narrative and lush illustrations.

Stories told in both words and haunting illustrations, THINGS FROM THE FLOOD captures a not-too-distant reality that is both haunting and imminent: addressing the many ways developing technology and nature can create havoc and wonder in our world... and the hope we might still find in that future.

**Perfect for fans of everything from STRANGER THINGS to JURASSIC PARK to JUMANJI, Things from the Flood is an incredible, unmissable work of genius.**
